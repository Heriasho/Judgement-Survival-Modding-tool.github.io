events.nighthowls.opening.text=In the end of times, civilization is a thing of the past. Gone is the electronic equipment that made life so much simpler, gone are the lights that kept the streets a bit safer at night and that kept us from seeing the beautiful night stars next to a glowing moon.\n\nSome might find this to be a romantic experience, were it not for the apocalypse. But it seems that {{survivor}} has developed a special interest in the night moon. This fascination was always apparent, but now it’s different. {{survivor}} can’t sleep anymore. {{survivor_hesheC}} walks around under the night sky, looking up at the moon. It’s perfect roundness, the subtle glow of off-white light shining in the distance spurs an uncontrollable urge. {{survivor_hesheC}} doesn't know where it came from, why or how; but it’s there - the urge to howl.\n\n{{survivor}} howls at the moon, and what may have started as a ridiculous imitation of a wolf cub, soon grows into a full fledged, blood chilling howl. The howl echoes in the distance, bouncing off abandoned buildings and ruined hideouts. {{survivor_hesheC}} eventually snaps out of it, but too late - the howl has attracted some unwanted attention!

events.nighthowls.research.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.research.text=This insatiable urge to howl will no doubt return, bringing further misfortune with it. You must find a way to deal with {{survivor}}.

events.nighthowls.foundwerewolf.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.foundwerewolf.text=Your occultists determined the source of this menace. It seems that {{survivor}} is inflicted with “the curse of the wolf”, an ancient curse told to drive men and women insane, making them believe they are wolves. This curse can be cured, however. All you need is… an actual wolf. More specifically, a werewolf. A small blood sample and a simple chant should remove this curse. The chant is easy to perform, but getting a blood sample will probably prove to be somewhat more difficult.\n\nYou remember hearing strange howls in the distance, surely it’s a werewolf. Perhaps you could convince the werewolf to donate some blood to a good cause… by brute force.

events.nighthowls.end.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.end.text={{survivor}} feels as if the weight of the world has been lifted off {{survivor_hisher}} shoulders. While the moon still shines bright and the stars still litter the night sky, the urge to howl is gone for good. Perhaps on all levels, {{survivor}} is no wolf, but a human being, eternally fascinated by the beauty of the night sky in a world desolated by the apocalypse.\n\nYou feel mystical power emenating from the claws of the werewolf, and form a pendant from it. Perhaps it will assist you in your struggles.

events.nighthowls.dead.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.dead.text=Death takes hold of {{survivor}}. {{survivor_hesheC}} will be sorely missed. {{survivor_hisherC}} body may be gone but {{survivor_hisher}} memory stays forever. With {{survivor_hisher}} death, the horrible curse is gone, and the camp no longer attracts unwanted attention.

events.badomens.research.title=Bad Omens
events.badomens.research.text=Dark clouds cover the night sky, the soft glow of the moon breaches through what little seams and holes it can find, illuminating with a weak, faint light, barely enough to see. A dark red comet streaks across the sky, coloring it in a dark, crimson red color. In what appears to be no less than witchcraft, the moon itself becomes red, its glow ominous. Demonic howls can be heard in the distance, these bad omens seem to give them unnatural strength.

events.badomens.resolved.title=Bad Omens
events.badomens.resolved.text=Your survivors discover an ancient manuscript mentioning a blood moon and an old religious ritual used to protect against it. After performing the ritual, the moon returns to its normal pale self, and the demonic howls immediately begin to wane. Things are back to normal.

Heavy bricks covered in dust and window fragments litter the roads and avenues of a once prospering city.\n\nA pile of rubble next to an abandoned building attracts your attention. Sure enough, the rubble holds a secret inside it - a black lockbox. The box is rather hefty, the lock in front of it seems to constitute quite a bit of its weight. It can probably be unlocked, using the proper tools.

events.lowmorale.reward2.text={{survivor}} ran all the way to the nearby ruins, ignoring any dangers on the way. A while later {{survivor_heshe}} made {{survivor_hisher}} way back to camp with a few scratches, and a splendid new weapon.

events.lowmorale.reward3.title=Desperate Times
events.lowmorale.reward3.text={{survivor}} walks all around camp, hiding anything that might seem out of place, removing all tracks and trails.
